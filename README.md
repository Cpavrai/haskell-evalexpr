## Goal

This is a project for being able to make any compute instruction with Haskell code.

## Architecture of code

	- app
		where is the main function

	- src
		where are every computing instruction

	- test
		where are tests (none actually)

## How does it work ?

First compile : `make`
Then launch it : `./funEvalExpr { your calcul }`.

## Any problem ?

Don't be shy and make an issue :)
